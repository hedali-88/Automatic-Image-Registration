This directory contains the source code for the Automatic Image Registration Method ( Paper titled 'Automatic Image Registration in Infrared-Visible Videos using Polygon Vertices'). 

It uses Background Substraction, Discrete Curve Evolution and Polygon Vertices Matching for image registration from visible and infrared modalities. 
For details please refer the paper.

The paper is available on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4232.pdf

The algorithm has dependency of SDK_LITIV and OpenCV 2.4.3. 
The libs of SDK_LITIV are contained in the lib folder under SDK_LITIV folder. 

Usage: Run the main.cpp in pointsMatcher directory. For changing the temporal buffer size change the NB_FRAME_MEMORY macro
